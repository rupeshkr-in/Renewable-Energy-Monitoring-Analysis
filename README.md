Renewable Energy Monitoring &amp; Analysis using Power BI

## Objective of Renewable Energy Monitoring & Analysis:

To track, analyze, and optimize renewable energy generation and capacity across various technologies and regions. It ensures efficient resource utilization, identifies trends, and supports data-driven decision-making for sustainability. The goal is to enhance energy transition efforts, reduce carbon footprints, and promote clean energy adoption worldwide.



## Here’s a step-by-step summary of my process in a structured way:



### Step 1: Data Collection & Loading

🔹 Obtained the renewable energy dataset from the International Monetary Fund.

 🔹 Loaded the dataset into Power BI for transformation and analysis.



### Step 2: Data Cleaning & Transformation

✅ Corrected inconsistencies in country names, energy types, and technology classifications.

✅ Handling Missing & Duplicate Values: Removed or imputed missing values in critical columns like energy capacity and generation. Eliminated duplicate records to prevent data redundancy.

✅ Removed Unnecessary Columns to streamline the dataset and retain relevant information.

 ✅ Unpivoted Yearly Data for electricity capacity and generation, converting it into a structured, long-format table for better trend analysis.

 ✅ Standardized Data Types to ensure consistency and improve processing efficiency  and also ensured uniform formatting of column names for better readability.

This transformation made the dataset more dynamic and insightful for energy analytics



### Step 3: DAX Calculations

🔢 Applied DAX functions to compute key metrics, such as:

Production capacity and Generation

Renewable generation 

Renewable generation to total generation ratio

Renewable production capacity 

Renewable production capacity to total capacity ratio



## Step 4: Visualization

### 📊 Created interactive dashboards showcasing:

 🔹 Generation by Energy Type – A clear breakdown of Renewable vs. Non-Renewable energy generation.

 🔹 Renewable to Total Energy Ratio – Measuring the shift toward sustainability.

 🔹 Renewable Generation by Technology – Analyzing contributions from Wind, Solar, Hydropower, and Bioenergy.

 🔹 Renewable Capacity Growth Over Time – Tracking advancements in clean energy adoption.

This structured approach helped in deriving meaningful insights for renewable energy trends and sustainability analysis. 🌱🚀



## Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of key insights from the dashboard: 



### 🔹 1️⃣ Generation by Energy Type (Renewable vs. Non-Renewable)

 📊 Over the past 22 years:

 ✅ Renewable energy generation increased by 5.5 million gigawatt-hours.

 ✅ Non-renewable energy generation grew even more, by 7.6 million gigawatt-hours.

 💡 While both have expanded, the reliance on fossil fuels remains a challenge for sustainability.

🔹 2️⃣ Renewable to Total Energy Ratio

 🌱 How much of our energy is renewable in 2022?

 ✅ 43% of total installed capacity now comes from renewables.

 ✅ However, renewables contribute only 32% to total energy generation.

 💡 This gap highlights the need for efficiency improvements in renewable energy production.

🔹 3️⃣ Renewable Generation by Technology (Wind, Solar, Hydropower, Bioenergy)

 ☀️🌊🌬️ Breaking down renewable sources:

 ✅ Hydropower remains the largest contributor, but wind and solar are growing rapidly.

 ✅ Bioenergy plays a smaller yet crucial role in the energy mix.

 💡 Diversifying technology adoption is key to a balanced and resilient energy future.

🔹 4️⃣ Renewable Capacity Growth by Technology Over the Years

 📈 Over time:

 ✅ Solar and wind capacity have seen exponential growth, thanks to technological advancements and policy support.

 ✅ Hydropower capacity has remained stable, indicating a matured sector.

 💡 Continued investment in solar and wind infrastructure is vital for a cleaner energy transition.

🌍 These insights highlight the progress and challenges in the global shift toward renewable energy. Excited to keep exploring data-driven solutions for a sustainable future!
